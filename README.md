# Porteclair

Porteclair iOS application provides understandable lightning information allowing users to make informed decisions. 
It was designed and created as part of my third year project at the University of Bath. Porteclair is an entire system composed of lighweight sensors, time of flight algorithms that displays lightning activity in a friendly way through an mobile application. 
More details on its capability and design can be found within this repo (brochure and poster)
